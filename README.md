# vue-file-upload-component

A simple file upload component for Vue.js. Emits events for XHR Upload Progress for nice progress bars.

I came up with the original idea when looking at [this repo](https://github.com/tj/s3.js). I knew I wanted a nice component with upload progress and so I copied some code from that library.
